# COVID-19-Analysis
The analysis consists of global confirmed cases of Covid 19 from January 2020 to June 2022.This dashboard does not include insights on the recovered cases and cases of deaths reported.Further analysis can therefore be done on those insights.
# Tools used
The only tool used for this analysis was Microsoft excel
# Data preparation
The data was obtained from  https://aka.ms/30DLCOVID19GitHubData which was used in a tutorial video by @ Onyibooke on the 30 days of data learning.The data was extracted from the data source using power query,further transformations were done to the 3 datasets(global confirmed cases,recovered cases,death cases) and it was finally merged into one consolidated data.
# Data Cleaning
Some errors were noticed in the column for date;the dates were not in the same format so it was converted to the United states date format to make it uniform.3 additional columns were added for year,month and day.A pivot table was then created for further analysis of the data.The data was visualized using bar charts,column charts and line charts.
